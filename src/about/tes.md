In a predominantly front-end focused team, I worked to support an important digital transition for TES, a long-standing education platform that connects teachers and schools around the globe. As the demands on the product grew, the need for a modern stack became apparent, and this was the focus of my work. Through these updates I focused on improving the level of functional accessibility in our components, and worked closely with the design team to rework and update components and high-level UI.

My expertise with React allowed me to contribute to the product by supporting team members across squads who were at the beginning of journey with the framework. This effort opened more avenues of cross-team collaboration and through that, company-wide knowledge sharing.
