TES is a hundred-year-old organisation that began as a magazine, and has transitioned into a digital education platform that connects teachers with schools around the world.

Our team is responsible for the fundamental connection between both partiesâ€”advertising positions in schools to teachers. Some time ago the technology powering the website was transformed into a JavaScript stack, from C#. Our work has revolved primarily around modernising that change. Our efforts honed in on improving our page performance, SEO, bundle sizes, UI, and accessibility.

Within that, my responsibilities lie in supporting the squad by mentoring junior members of the team, providing insight on the best practices, performance enhancements, and emerging technology within our chosen tech stack. And consequently, propelling the necessary changes forward through company-wide knowledge sharing and cross-team collaboration.

That effort has cascaded into other squads across the company, where we strive to make changes to shared frontend components and services that will contribute to similar improvements to other products within the business.
