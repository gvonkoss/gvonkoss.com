TES is an education platform that connects teachers with schools around the world. It originally began as a print-based offering, and has transitioned into a digital platform over the last few years.

Our team is responsible for the fundamental connection between both partiesâ€”advertising positions in schools to teachers. Some time ago the technology powering the website was transformed into a JavaScript stack, from C#. Our work has revolved primarily around moderinizing that change. Our efforts honed in on improving our page performance, SEO, bundle sizes, UI, and accessibility.

That effort has cascaded into other squads across the company, where we strive to make changes to shared components and services that will contribute to similar improvements to other products within the business.
