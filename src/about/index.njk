<h2>Personally</h2>
<div class="content--about__personal">
  <p>
    I speak, read and write English, German, Spanish and
    Portuguese. I tried learning Japanese, but can currently
    only order beer üçª.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was born in Brazil, but I‚Äôve lived in eight different countries
    over the course of my life so far. Living in different cultures and in
    different languages has taught me flexibility, resourcefulness,
    adaptability and deeper empathy.
  </p>
  <p>
    I like to make physical things and learn new trades (like wood
    turning! Or taxidermy!). I believe this helps improve and constantly evolve my
    approach to problem solving, as I am regularly challenged to
    think differently.

    I made this website with a lot of love and care‚Äîit's hosted by 
    <a href="https://netlify.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      Netlify
    </a> and generated by 
    <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      Eleventy</a>.
    Its most obvious feature is the customisability, but behind the scenes it is also sensitive to accessibility preferences like reduced-motion and colour contrast, and reacts to the absence of JavaScript.
    Our individual experiences of the web are different, after all.
