As a strong competitor in the digital banking marketplace, N26 established itself in a number of different countries around the world in its first three years of existence.

Growth of that speed implied many interesting challenges around compliance and legislation for different users across the globe, where performance was key, as was up-to-date and easy-to-access information about their bank accounts. Though the banking application is most widely used, the web-based platform was an important player in terms of transparency for our users. It was a faced paced environment, where adaptability, stability and security were key.

The work we did for web platform was focused heavily on accessibility, internationalisation and visual, behavioural and secure continuity across all products, in every country.
