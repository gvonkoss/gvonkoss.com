During my time at N26, the digital bank experienced significant growth, expanding across continents and countries. In a dedicated web-focused team distributed across squads, I focused on building out features for a product that was centered around compliance and legislation in different economic markets. That included developing the internationalisation and accessibility to cover a varied range of languages and regulations.

In banking, clarity is vital for a positive user experience, and due to this and the multiple variables of operating in various markets, I had the opportunity to work in continuous contact with designers, with small feeback loops to ensure a consistent and easy-to-navigate user interface.
