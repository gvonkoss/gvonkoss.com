Working alongside a cross-functional team, I built a new collaboration platform for Hotjar users. The objective was to deliver this feature by causing minimal disruption to regular product operations, with minimal technical debt. In this process I contributed to Hotjar's design system, restructured the collaboration data query system to update, clear and identify technical debt, and managed a cohesive collaboration timeline across five teams affected by the feature.

Many of the Hotjar's direct clients rely on the product providing high standards of web accessibility. By collaborating with the respective product teams, I researched and coordinated a professional audit for the aspects of Hotjar's products that were public-facing. The audit provided a source of education and a foundation on which to build more accessible products.
