Hotjar is a behavioural data analytics platform. It provides its clients with feedback about their users behaviour on their website, enabling them to improve their user experience.

There are two facets to Hotjarâ€”what the client's user sees, and what the client sees. Our team focused on the client-facing dashboard, specifically on collaboration. Our goal was to release features that would enable teams to work together successfully, while maintaining existing features and keeping our technical debt to a minimum.

In addition to our regular feature work, I led Hotjar's accessibility initiative, which included organising and processing external audits, and focused on providing in-house guidelines, education and support for engineering, design and product teams, with the goal of improving the product's overall approach to accessibility.
