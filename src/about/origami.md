For over two years I wore a number of hats alongside three other colleagues, carefully maintaining, updating and improving Origami, the Financial Times' component library. I worked very closely with design, did a lot of user research and developed clear communication guidelnes to support the 300+ network of developers and designers that worked under the Financial Times' brand, both in-house and third party.

The team's main collective and continuous goals were: maintaining the FT's accessibility certification through the components in the library, ensuring clear and updated documentation, and providing high level customisation for the multiple brands that have come to rely on the Origami components.
