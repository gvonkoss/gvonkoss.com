Origami is the Financial Times' component library. We worked on
delivering brand and behavioural consistency across all FT
products, both internal and external.

We supported every customer and developer facing team under the FT brand. This
involved close work with design, a lot of user research and
clear, open communication. We maintained template-agnostic
components and a number of different services to power
customer products in a visual and performant way.

Some of the primary focus points were
improving our documentation, simplifiying our components
for our users, allowing product-specific customisation, and
managing our workflow with custom webhooks and improved
internal tooling.
