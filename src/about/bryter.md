I worked with no-code legal platform BRYTER in a small team made up of a designer and another front-end developer to create, document and apply a new design system. We aimed to create a system that would support all of the intricate products that our colleagues built. Having close contact with our users, both developers and designers, helped us streamline the project with tighter feedback cycles.

The results of that manifested as the foundation of maintainable system with supportive, inclusive documentation for product owners, and clear contribution guidelines for designers and developers. Fundamental to the system were ease of adoption and built-in accessibility. Finally, this system became an educational springboard for in-house support and education around web accessibility.

Originally, the design system was open-sourced. It was important to the team to be able to share in the design system community across the industry, as we can get feedback on our work and take inspiration from others. However the company has chosen to make the respository private since then.
