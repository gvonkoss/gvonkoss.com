BRYTER is a no-code platform that enables experts to automate decision making in their respective fields. The platform is predominantly used by corporate compliance, legal and tax departments to digitize and distribute decision making knowledge, and by consultants (law firms, auditors) to productise and scale expertise.

In a tiny nutshell, BRYTER works on making the work of others easier. 

As an extension of that, Bliss, BRYTER's design system, aims to make the work of every contributor to the product easier, too. Currently, the Bliss is in it's infancy, and gaining traction. We're a small team that aims to build a robust and flexible system that supports technology-agnostic implementation, design guidelines and brand patterns.

The focus of our work lies in using web components, encapsulating styles and working accessibility into every component and style guide we provide. Not only will Bliss support the ongoing development of BRYTER's main product, but it is being created to support third party development as the features within our product expand. We've decided to make our efforts open source, and hope to support many different requirments of it as possible it in the future.

In addition to leading the technological aspect of the design system, my responsibilities are distributed between contributing to the community that governs the technical architecture and alignment across the product, as well as the community that aims to provide internal education and support around inter-personal and web accessibility concerns.
