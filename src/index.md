Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Gabi.

I'm half caffeine, half human; I split most of my time between making physical and digital things.

By day, I'm a web developer. Depending on the task at hand, I like to work with vanilla JS, React, CSS, SCSS and semantic HTML. Over the years I've learned a lot about accessibility, and I work hard on that, too. By night I rollerdance and run a tiny little cross stitch pattern shop.

Right now I live in Barcelona, Spain.
